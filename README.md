## Design Patterns
Welcome to the Github repository for design pattern exercises in Java! In this repository, you will find a collection of Java programs that demonstrate various design patterns commonly used in software development. These exercises are intended to help you gain a better understanding of how to implement these patterns in your own projects.

### Design Patterns Covered
This repository includes exercises that demonstrate the following design patterns:
* Creational Patterns: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory
* Structural Patterns:  [Facade](./Facade/README.md), [Flyweight](./FlyWeight/README.md), [Proxy](./Proxy/README.md)
* Behavioral Patterns: [Chain of Responsibility](./ChainOfResponsibility/README.md), [Template Method](./TemplateMethod/README.md)

Here you'll find several folders, each of which contains exercises related to a particular design pattern. The folders are named after the corresponding design patterns, such as "Singleton," "Factory," "Proxy," etc.

Each folder contains one or more Java classes that implement the corresponding design pattern. Additionally, there is a README file in each folder that provides a brief explanation of the design pattern and how it is used in the context of the exercise.
